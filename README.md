I have made Aqua Track - water tracker application.  
It is an Android Application.  
  
Stack use -  
Frontend: XML, Kotlin.  
Backend: Kotlin.  
Database: Firebase.  
IDE: Android studio.  
  
Download as a zip folder and extract or use command "git clone https://github.com/itzdanishsalmani/Water_Tracker_Application.git" to clone.    
Connect Firebase to Android studio.   
Create Project on Firebase and download the google-json file into Android studio.  
If database is stop responding after one month then increase the date of database in the rule section of Cloud firestore.  
It send notification everyday at 10 am.
